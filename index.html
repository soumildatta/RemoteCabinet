        <h2>Why build something local like this?</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Most file sync tools assume you are fine with a remote cloud owning your storage.
          <strong>RemoteCabinet flips that model.</strong> It treats your own machine as the
          cabinet, and gives you a simple protocol and CLI to open that cabinet from your other
          devices.
        </p>

            <h3>Own your storage</h3>
            <p>
              Every file lives on hardware you control. There is no dependency on an external
              provider, no opaque retention policies, and no background data mining.

            <h3>Stay close to the metal</h3>
            <p>
              RemoteCabinet is small and focused. You get a straightforward server and a CLI
              client, designed for LANs and home labs, without heavyweight dashboards or
              background daemons you do not understand.

              Because it is implemented in Python and lives on GitHub, you can read the code,
              extend the protocol, and integrate it into your own tooling and automations.

        <h2>What RemoteCabinet does</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          At its core, RemoteCabinet is a <strong>personal sync and backup service</strong>.
          One machine runs the server; other machines connect as clients, push and pull files,
          and stay in sync.
        </p>

            <h3>File sync & backup</h3>
            <p>
              Keep a chosen directory mirrored between your local machine and your RemoteCabinet
              server. Use it as a simple backup destination or a shared project workspace.

            <h3>Simple network protocol</h3>
            <p>
              A focused client–server protocol handles listing, uploading, downloading, and
              updating files, without the complexity of a full distributed filesystem.

            <h3>CLI-first workflow</h3>
            <p>
              RemoteCabinet is controlled via the command line, making it ideal for terminals,
              SSH sessions, scripts, cron jobs, and automated backups.

            <h3>Local trust model</h3>
            <p>
              Because the server runs in your own environment, you can integrate system-level
              security: firewalls, VPNs, SSH tunnels, and OS permissions.

              The codebase is structured for experimentation. Extend request types, add
              metadata, or plug in your own authentication and sync policies.

              protocol, build a networked application, and reason about sync semantics.

        <h2>How RemoteCabinet works</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          The architecture is intentionally small: a single server process, multiple CLI
          clients, and a clear separation between local folders and the remote cabinet.
        </p>

              <li>
                <strong>Start the server</strong><br />
                Run the RemoteCabinet server on a machine that has the storage you want to use
                as your cabinet.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Connect from your client</strong><br />
                From another machine on your network, run the client and point it to your
                server’s host and port.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Sync your folders</strong><br />
                Choose a local directory to sync. The client compares file states and transfers
                what is missing or outdated.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Automate if you want</strong><br />
                Wrap commands in scripts or cron jobs to turn RemoteCabinet into a scheduled
                backup or project mirror.

        <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
        <div class="faq">
          <details>
            <summary>Is RemoteCabinet a replacement for mainstream cloud storage?</summary>
            <p>
              Not directly. RemoteCabinet is more like a personal lab tool: it is small,
              understandable, and focused on local-first workflows. You can use it alongside
              cloud providers or instead of them, depending on your needs.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Do I need a public IP address?</summary>
            <p>
              No. RemoteCabinet works perfectly inside a local network or VPN. If you want to
              reach it from outside, you can expose the server yourself (for example via SSH
              tunneling, port forwarding, or a reverse proxy), keeping full control.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Is it secure?</summary>
            <p>
              The security model is intentionally transparent: the server runs on your hardware
              and inside your network. You can combine it with TLS, firewalls, and OS-level
              permissions. As with any self-hosted service, you should review the code and
              deployment setup for your environment.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Can I extend it?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes. The project is on GitHub, and the code is structured to be hackable. You can
              add new commands, enhance the protocol, or adapt the client for your own custom
              workflows.
