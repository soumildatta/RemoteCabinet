# RemoteCabinet

RemoteCabinet is a client-server architecture based command-line application that does a lot of things that Dropbox is known for. It allows clients to store files on the server, and allows synchronization between clients. This implementation of RemoteCabinet shows that a Dropbox-like application can be deployed with a TCP/IP protocol to completely work on devices that are readily available to users safely and securely without relying on outside services.
